<h3>License</h3>
<p>The source code for the 3D vector math API reference
implementation is licensed under terms that are yet to be disclosed.
Until such time as these terms are disclosed, you may not do anything
at all with the source code in this CVS repository.<br>
</p>
<p>The API specification will continue to evolve as part of the
<a href="http://jcp.org/">Java Community Process (JCP)</a>.
We welcome community participation, and encourage developers to
contribute both bug fixes and new implementation code to the API.
The terms under which we will license this source code will facilitate
this, while ensuring that the API is not fragmented with incompatible
versions being released.<br>
