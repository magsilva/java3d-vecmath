<p>This project contains the source code
for the 3D vector math package, <code>javax.vecmath</code>.<br>
</p>
<p>Related projects include: <a href="https://j3d-core.dev.java.net/">j3d-core</a>
(the core Java&nbsp;3D<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> API),
<a href="https://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a>
(the Java&nbsp;3D core utilities), and
<a href="https://j3d-examples.dev.java.net/">j3d-examples</a>
(the Java&nbsp;3D example programs). Refer to the <a
 href="build-instr.html">download
and build
instructions</a> for information on downloading and building vecmath.
</p>
<h3><a name="License"></a>License</h3>
<p>The source code for the 3D vector math API reference
implementation
is licensed under the <a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/jrl.html"
 target="_blank">Java
Research License (JRL)</a> for non-commercial use. The JRL allows users
to download, build, and modify the source code in the vecmath project
for research use, subject to the terms of the license.
</p>
<p>The vecmath source code is also licensed for commercial use under a
new
no-fee <a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/jdl-java3d.pdf"
 target="_blank">Java
Distribution License (JDL)</a>. The JDL
allows commercial use of vecmath with or without modification, as
long as compatibility with the entire API Specification is maintained.
This includes passing the TCK tests for vecmath, and retaining the
javax namespace as defined by the JCP.
</p>
<p>
The API specification will continue to evolve as part of the Java
Community Process (JCP). We welcome community participation, and
encourage developers to contribute both bug fixes and new
implementation code to the API. The combination of the JRL and the JDL
was chosen to facilitate this, while ensuring the integrity and
compatibility of the API.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="Downloads"></a>Downloads</h3>
<p>Three types of binary builds are available in the <a
 href="https://j3d-core.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Documents
&amp; Files</a> page of the j3d-core project on java.net: Release (or
FCS) builds;
Experimental (early access) builds; and Daily/Weekly builds. The latest
release build of Java&nbsp;3D v1.3.1 is available. A fairly stable
experimental build, labeled as Java&nbsp;3D v 1.3.2-build4 is now
available. We will set up daily or weekly builds in the near future.<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="How_to_Contribute"></a>How to Contribute</h3>
<p>We invite developers to contribute to Java&nbsp;3D. Please refer to
the
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/contribute.html">Contributing to
Java&nbsp;3D</a> section in the parent java3d project to learn
how to contribute to this project or any other Java&nbsp;3D-related
project. See the <a href="https://javadesktop.dev.java.net/govern.html">JavaDesktop
Community Governance Guidelines</a> for general guidelines on
participating in JavaDesktop community projects, such as vecmath.
</p>
<h3><a name="Reporting_Issues"></a>Reporting Issues<br>
</h3>
<p>We have set up the <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">Issue Tracker</a>
in the parent java3d
project
to track issues (bugs, feature requests, etc.) for
Java&nbsp;3D-related
sub-projects. Please use the above link rather than the Issue Tracker
in this vecmath project. Refer to the <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/index.html#Reporting_Issues">Reporting
Issues</a> section in the parent java3d project for more information.
</p>
<h3><a name="Feedback_and_Discussion"></a>Feedback and Discussion<br>
</h3>
<p>We have created four Java&nbsp;3D mailing lists in the parent <a
 href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/">java3d</a> project:&nbsp;<span
 style="color: blue;">interest 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
<span style="color: blue;">announce 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
<span style="color: blue;">issues 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>,
and <span style="color: blue;">cvs 'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>
(replace 'at' with @).
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click
here to subscribe</a> to any of these lists. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">interest</span> list is an open mailing
list for
discussing all aspects of Java&nbsp;3D, the reference implementation
for the
Java&nbsp;3D core, vecmath, utilities, example programs, etc. The <span
 style="font-style: italic;">annouce</span> list is a
low-volume moderated mailing list for announcing Java&nbsp;3D-related
news
and information. The <span style="font-style: italic;">issues</span>
list is for automated issues tracking, and the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">cvs</span> list is for automated CVS
change messages (for changes to the parent java3d web pages only).</p>
<p>For those who prefer a forum to a discussion mailing list, we have
created the
<a href="https://java3d.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectForumView"
 target="_blank">Java&nbsp;3D
forum</a>, hosted as part of the JavaDesktop Community. Messages
posted on the forum are cross-posted to <span style="color: blue;">interest
'at' java3d.dev.java.net</span>
and vice-versa.<br>
</p>
<p>Finally, each sub-project has its own cvs mailing
list.&nbsp;<a href="servlets/ProjectMailingListList">Click here to
subscribe</a> to this list. The <span style="color: blue;">cvs 'at'
vecmath.dev.java.net</span>
list is for automated CVS change messages and discussion of those
changes.<br>

<h3><a name="Examples"></a>Examples</h3>
<p>We don't yet have any vecmath-only example programs. However, all of
the example programs in the <a
 href="https://j3d-examples.dev.java.net/">j3d-examples</a>
project use
the vecmath API.</p>
