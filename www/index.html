<body>
<p>This project contains the source code
for the 3D vector math package, <code>javax.vecmath</code>.<br>
</p>
<p>Related projects include: <a href="http://j3d-core.dev.java.net/">j3d-core</a>
(the core Java&nbsp;3D API),
<a href="http://j3d-core-utils.dev.java.net/">j3d-core-utils</a>
(the Java&nbsp;3D core utilities), and

<h3>License</h3>
<p>The source code for the 3D vector math API reference
implementation is available for research use
under the TBD1 license [TODO: license link].
It is also available for commercial use
under the TBD2 license [TODO: license link].
The API specification will continue to evolve as part of the Java
Community Process (JCP). We welcome community
participation, and encourage developers to
contribute both bug fixes and
new implementation code to the API. The TBD1 and TBD2 licenses were
chosen to
facilitate this, while ensuring that the API is not fragmented with
incompatible versions being released.<br>
